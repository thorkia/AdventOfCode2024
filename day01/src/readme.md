Day 1 Part 1

We have 2 lists of numbers. We need to find difference betweem the lowest in each, then the next lowest, and so on.
We sum those differences, and that is our answer.

We will extract both lists, sort them, then add the difference of each element to a running total.

Day 1 Part 2

When we parse list 1, we will turn it into a list

We will do the same with list 2, but incrementing the count for each value.

Then we will iterate through list 1 and multiply it by the value in the hasmap, and keep a running total.
